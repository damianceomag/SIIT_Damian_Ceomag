    <h3>Rules for Autocomplete</h3>

    <i>Posted on March 19, 2019</i>

    <p>
        Autocompleting text with known values seems like an easy problem to solve, but so so so many UIs get it wrong. I
        see this frequently enough that, rather than complain about them individually, I though I’d just write down the
        set of rules they often break.</p>
    <p>
        There may be cases where some of these rules aren’t the best thing to do, but there should be a good reason for
        breaking one of these rules (for example, some of these rules don’t apply if a field must be filled with a value
        from a fixed set, like the list of US states). Following these rules should always result in at very least a
        sane experience:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Exact matches always come first. If the user types in an option exactly, other options must always go below
            the one matching what they typed.
        </li>

        <li>
            Besides exact matches, prefix matches come first. If I type “Fr” I want “Fresno” not “San Francisco.”
        </li>

        <li>
            After prefix matches, it can fall back to substring matches. Starting with substring matches would almost
            always be the wrong thing to do since users start typing words at the beginning not somewhere in the middle.
        </li>

        <li>
            If there are no substring matches, it can optionally fall back to subsequence matching. This is only useful
            in some cases.
        </li>

        <li>
            If there are no subsequence/substring matches, it can optionally fall back to approximate matches. This is
            rarely necessary to provide.
        </li>
    </ul>
